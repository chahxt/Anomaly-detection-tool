# Anomaly Detection Tool

## Description
This project implements an anomaly detection tool that utilizes machine learning models to identify anomalies in various types of data. The core models used for anomaly detection include autoencoders and training routines. It is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend and integrate with other types of data and models.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following components:

- **models**: Contains the trained machine learning models used for anomaly detection.
- **src**: Includes the source code and scripts responsible for training models and performing anomaly detection.
  - **train.py**: Script to train the model.
  - **autoencoder.py**: Autoencoder implementation used for anomaly detection.
  - **other scripts**: Any additional scripts that may exist, like data preprocessing or evaluation scripts.
- **data**: This folder would normally contain the datasets used for training and testing; however, due to file size limitations, the actual data frames are not posted in this repository.
- **output**: Contains the results and outputs generated by the model. This can include predictions, plots, and other relevant output files.
